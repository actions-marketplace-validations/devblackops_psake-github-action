## Usage

```hcl

    # https://github.com/devblackops/psake-github-actions/releases
    uses = "devblackops/psake-github-actions/task@<latest tag>"

    # If you need to change the default psakeFile name, PSDepend requirements file,
    # or skip requirements installation entirely, specify here.
    # See Environment Variables below for details.
    env = {
        PSAKE_FILE = "./psakeFile.ps1"
    }

    # The psake task(s) to execute
    args = ["Test"]
}
```

## Environment Variables

```hcl
action "psake test" {
    ...
    args = ["Test"]
}
```

Execute the `init`, `build`, and `test` psake tasks.

```hcl
action "psake test" {
    ...
    args = ["init, build, test"]
}
```
